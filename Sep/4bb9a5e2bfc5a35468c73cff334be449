Khanyisile is also the cousin of Uyinene Mrwetyana. “I’m here to protest against women being raped,” she says. “I’m also a survivor and I’m here to stand for every woman who never had a word to speak out. I’m here to stand for every four or five-year-old child who isn’t capable of standing up for themselves and saying, ‘Enough is Enough!’ The police are not doing anything. I’m here to stand for Uyinene.”
“At least with the death penalty we know that there’s going to be a change. If they are not sure, let them give it a try. The reason we don’t want lifetime in prison [for murderers] is there is freedom in prison. They get an education, they are fed. They even have access to social media and whatnot. When you have murdered someone, that person is no longer here. I’m still grieving for that. It’s a lifetime pain.”
